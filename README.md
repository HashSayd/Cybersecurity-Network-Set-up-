# Cybersecurity-Network-Set-up-

Objective
The objective of this project was to design and implement a secure network environment with a focus on cybersecurity best practices. The setup included configuring firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation to simulate a real-world enterprise security architecture. The project aimed to provide practical experience in building a defensible network and understanding how to protect against common cyber threats.

Skills Learned
- Network Architecture Design: Gained hands-on experience in planning and building a layered, secure network infrastructure.
- Firewall Configuration: Set up and fine-tuned firewall rules to control traffic flow and enforce security policies.
- IDS/IPS Deployment: Installed and configured intrusion detection and prevention systems (e.g., Snort) to monitor and react to suspicious activity.
- Network Segmentation: Implemented subnetting and VLANs to limit lateral movement and isolate sensitive systems.
- Security Hardening: Applied best practices to secure routers, switches, and endpoints against unauthorized access.
- Log Management: Enabled logging and centralized log collection for visibility into network activities.
- Threat Mitigation Strategies: Identified vulnerabilities and implemented controls to reduce risk and exposure to attacks.
